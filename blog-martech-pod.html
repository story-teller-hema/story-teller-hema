<h1>Building a Martech Pod: Scaling Adobe Analytics at Enterprise Level</h1>
<div class="post-meta"><span>October 2025</span><span>•</span><span>10 min read</span></div>
</header>
<div class="post-intro">Managing 2 FTE and 5 embedded consultants across three continents taught me everything about pod structure, agile ceremonies, vendor partnerships, and talent development. Here's the operating model that powers analytics at scale.</div>
<div class="content">
<h2>The Challenge: Enterprise Analytics Without Enterprise Chaos</h2>
<p>When you're running Adobe Analytics, Customer Journey Analytics, and Target for a global QSR brand, the tech stack is the easy part. The hard part is the people, processes, and politics. How do you deliver 50+ concurrent experiments without breaking prod? How do you align stakeholders across Digital, Marketing, CRM, Product, and Tech? How do you scale without becoming a bottleneck?</p>
<p>The answer: a well-structured pod operating model.</p>

```
<h2>Pod Structure: 2 FTE + 5 Consultants</h2>
<p><strong>FTE Strategists (2):</strong> Own roadmap, stakeholder management, business requirements, and outcomes. We're the "what" and "why."</p>
<p><strong>Embedded Consultants (5):</strong> Execute tagging, experimentation, analytics builds, and QA. They're the "how." Embedded means they sit in our sprints, report to our backlog, and have SLAs we own.</p>
<p>Why this split? Strategy can't scale if strategists are writing SDRs and debugging Launch rules. Execution can't succeed without clear requirements and business context. The pod bridges both.</p>
<h2>Agile Ceremonies That Actually Work</h2>
<p><strong>Weekly Sprint Planning (Mondays, 60 min):</strong> Review backlog, prioritize top 10 items, assign to consultants, flag blockers. No status updates—those happen async in Azure DevOps.</p>
<p><strong>Daily Standups (15 min):</strong> Only for active projects. Answer three questions: What shipped yesterday? What's shipping today? What's blocked? If nothing's blocked, skip it.</p>
<p><strong>Bi-Weekly Backlog Grooming (Thursdays, 45 min):</strong> Refine upcoming work, estimate effort, kill zombie tickets that will never ship. This is where we say "no" to low-ROI requests.</p>
<p><strong>Monthly Business Reviews (Last Friday, 90 min):</strong> Present results to senior leadership. Show metrics that matter: conversion lifts, revenue impact, test velocity. No vanity metrics.</p>
<div class="insight-box">
<h3>💡 The "No Meeting" Rule</h3>
<p>We protect 3-hour blocks (Tue/Wed/Thu mornings) where no meetings are scheduled. Deep work requires uninterrupted time. Strategists use this for roadmap planning. Consultants use it for complex implementations. Productivity doubled when we enforced this.</p>
</div>
<h2>Vendor Management: Partners, Not Vendors</h2>
<p>Our consultants came from a Martech agency. The key to success: treating them as partners, not outsourced labor.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Co-own outcomes:</strong> They have skin in the game. If conversion doesn't lift, we troubleshoot together.</li>
<li><strong>Invest in training:</strong> Paid for Adobe certifications, sent them to Summit, included them in strategy discussions.</li>
<li><strong>Clear SLAs:</strong> 48hr turnaround for tagging tickets, 1-week for experiment builds, 24hr for production bugs. No ambiguity.</li>
<li><strong>Feedback loops:</strong> Quarterly retros to discuss what's working, what's not, and how to improve collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Talent Development: Growing the Team</h2>
<p>How do you retain top talent in Martech when everyone's recruiting?</p>
<p><strong>1. Career pathing:</strong> Junior consultants → Senior consultants → Strategic advisors. Clear progression.</p>
<p><strong>2. Skill diversification:</strong> Rotate people across Analytics, Target, CJA, and AJO so they don't get pigeonholed.</p>
<p><strong>3. Visibility to leadership:</strong> Bring consultants to business reviews. Let them present their work. Recognition matters.</p>
<p><strong>4. Autonomy:</strong> Senior consultants own entire workstreams (e.g., "You own all kiosk analytics"). Ownership drives engagement.</p>
<h2>The Backlog: How We Prioritize</h2>
<p>With 100+ stakeholder requests at any time, prioritization is everything. Our framework:</p>
<p><strong>Tier 1 (Do Now):</strong> Revenue-blocking bugs, exec commitments, regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 2 (Do This Quarter):</strong> High-impact tests, strategic initiatives aligned to OKRs.</p>
<p><strong>Tier 3 (Do Someday/Maybe):</strong> Nice-to-haves, exploratory work, "someone mentioned this once" ideas.</p>
<p>We kill Tier 3 ruthlessly. If it hasn't moved to Tier 2 in 3 months, it's not important.</p>
<h2>Governance: Standards Without Bureaucracy</h2>
<p>Enterprise analytics needs guardrails, not red tape.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SDRs (Solution Design References):</strong> Every implementation has one. Non-negotiable.</li>
<li><strong>Analytics Playbooks:</strong> Region-specific guides for tagging standards, naming conventions, QA checklists.</li>
<li><strong>Consent Frameworks:</strong> GDPR/CCPA compliance baked into every implementation from day one.</li>
<li><strong>Code Reviews:</strong> No Launch rule or Target activity ships without peer review. Catches 90% of bugs pre-prod.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cross-Functional Alignment</h2>
<p>Martech pods don't exist in isolation. We partnered closely with:</p>
<p><strong>Product:</strong> Aligned on roadmap, ensured analytics instrumentation was part of feature specs.</p>
<p><strong>Engineering:</strong> Embedded in their sprints for tagging releases, participated in architecture reviews.</p>
<p><strong>CRM/Loyalty:</strong> Co-owned journey orchestration, shared audience segmentation logic.</p>
<p><strong>Media:</strong> Provided attribution data, collaborated on UTM standards and campaign tracking.</p>
<div class="insight-box">
<h3>🧠 The Weekly Sync That Changed Everything</h3>
<p>We instituted a weekly 30-min sync with Product, Engineering, and CRM leads. Just alignment—no decisions, no deep dives. Reduced miscommunication by 80%. Most "urgent" requests were solved in that room before becoming tickets.</p>
</div>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p><strong>1. Hire for adaptability:</strong> Martech changes constantly. Hire people who learn fast, not people who know one tool perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>2. Document relentlessly:</strong> Tribal knowledge kills scale. Every process, every decision, every edge case gets documented.</p>
<p><strong>3. Celebrate wins publicly:</strong> When a test drives $500K revenue, tell everyone. Martech is often invisible work—make it visible.</p>
<p><strong>4. Say no often:</strong> Your job isn't to do everything. It's to do the right things. Protect the team's capacity.</p>
<p><strong>5. Automate the boring stuff:</strong> Reporting, dashboards, recurring QA checks—automate it. Free up brainpower for strategy.</p>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>In 18 months, this pod structure enabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>50+ concurrent A/B tests without production incidents</li>
<li>Deployment velocity: 2-week average from request to launch</li>
<li>Zero consultant turnover (industry average is 40% annually)</li>
<li>Stakeholder satisfaction score: 4.7/5</li>
<li>Revenue impact: $10M+ attributed to optimization initiatives</li>
</ul>
<p>Operating models aren't sexy. But they're the difference between a Martech team that's constantly firefighting and one that's driving business outcomes. Build the structure right, and the results follow.</p>
